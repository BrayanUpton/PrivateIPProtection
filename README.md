# Private IP Protection - Confidential Patent Application System

A blockchain-based patent application system leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to protect intellectual property throughout the entire application and review process.

## üîê Core Concept

This system revolutionizes patent application management by implementing **end-to-end encryption for sensitive intellectual property data**. Using Zama's FHE technology, patent applications remain encrypted on-chain while still enabling authorized examiners to review and process them without ever exposing the underlying sensitive information.

### Key Innovation: FHE-Powered Privacy

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** enables computation on encrypted data without decryption. In the context of patent applications:

- **Encrypted Storage**: Patent titles, descriptions, claims, and categories are stored as encrypted values (euint32, euint8)
- **Confidential Processing**: Examiners can review applications and make decisions while data remains encrypted
- **Access Control**: Only authorized parties (applicant, assigned examiner, patent office) can access specific applications
- **Zero-Knowledge Reviews**: Review feedback and decisions can also be encrypted, maintaining confidentiality

## üéØ Project Features

### For Patent Applicants
- Submit patent applications with full confidentiality
- All sensitive data (title, description, claims) encrypted on-chain
- Track application status in real-time
- Withdraw applications if needed
- Pay application fees securely (0.1 ETH)

### For Patent Examiners
- Access authorized applications only
- Review confidential applications without compromising security
- Submit encrypted review feedback
- Choose public or confidential decision disclosure
- Track workload and completed reviews

### For Patent Office Administrators
- Authorize qualified patent examiners
- Assign applications to specialized examiners
- Monitor system-wide statistics
- Manage application workflow
- Withdraw accumulated fees

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

**Application Status States:**
- Pending: Initial submission state
- Under Review: Assigned to examiner
- Approved: Patent granted
- Rejected: Application denied
- Withdrawn: Cancelled by applicant

**Encrypted Data Fields:**
- `euint32 encryptedTitle`: FHE-encrypted title hash
- `euint32 encryptedDescription`: FHE-encrypted description hash
- `euint32 encryptedClaims`: FHE-encrypted claims hash
- `euint8 category`: FHE-encrypted patent category
- `euint32 encryptedFeedback`: FHE-encrypted examiner feedback

### Access Control System

Three-tier access control ensures data confidentiality:
1. **Applicant Access**: Full access to own applications
2. **Examiner Access**: Access to assigned applications only
3. **Patent Office Access**: Administrative oversight capabilities

## üìä Technical Implementation

### FHE Integration

The system uses Zama's fhEVM library for encryption operations:

```solidity
import { FHE, euint32, euint8, ebool } from "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";
```

### Key Security Features

- **Confidentiality Tracking**: Boolean flag monitors if application data remains confidential
- **Viewer Logging**: Tracks all addresses that access application data
- **Emergency Reveal**: Authorized mechanism for dispute resolution
- **Integrity Verification**: On-chain verification of application data integrity

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Guarantees

### Data Encryption
All sensitive intellectual property data is encrypted using FHE before being submitted to the blockchain. This ensures:
- **On-chain Privacy**: Raw patent data never appears on blockchain
- **Computation on Encrypted Data**: Reviews performed without decryption
- **Selective Disclosure**: Only authorized parties can access specific applications

### Confidentiality Monitoring
The system tracks confidentiality status:
- Initial state: `confidentialityMaintained = true`
- Automatic flagging on suspicious access patterns
- Event emission on potential breaches
- Permanent on-chain audit trail

### Access Logging
Every access attempt is recorded:
- Viewer addresses logged for each application
- Timestamp and context captured
- Immutable audit trail for compliance
- Dispute resolution support
